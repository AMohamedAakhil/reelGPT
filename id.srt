That some of these are bhu ar舞

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,800
Mr. Janama Math yearseth

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,400
That some of these are bhu ar舞

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,280
Janama Math night of her day

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,880
Guruvani has a pankati

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,720
Maniva Mathichi

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,880
He has a good time

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,320
He has a good time to keep his humbleness

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,120
Guruvani has a good time

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,880
He has a lot of his dignity

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,800
I wanted to get a sense

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,040
I wanted to understand more about Guru Nanak

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,280
What is the word Guru actually mean?

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
That is my curiosity

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Guru has a very specific meaning

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,040
And the meaning of Guru is someone who shows you the path towards truth

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,080
So for example, if you have a very good chemistry teacher

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,400
And he is very good at teaching chemistry

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,840
But he is lying

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,040
He is not a Guru

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,320
He is a teacher but he is not a Guru

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,800
That was where I started from

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,240
In Sikhism it is very clear that there is a sense of community

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:38,040
He wanted someone to explain to him the fundamental principles of how the Sikh religion evolved

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,400
What are the practices and what is the history of Sikhs?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:51,400
When I was doing the Shiva, it was naturally set up for me to question my ego

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,720
There the community is helping you do it

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,600
So the community is saying the three tenets

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,240
First idea that you have to work

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,720
Meaning that you can't be a parasite on society

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,000
Second idea that when you are working

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,440
You have to observe what you are doing

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,280
And you have to observe the effect of what you are doing on other people

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,320
And third idea that whatever you do

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,720
Some benefit of your effort has to go to other people

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,960
So that immediately builds the community

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,640
And it is the community that acts as a vehicle

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,600
For challenging the idea of the self

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
For challenging ego

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
For challenging hatred

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
For challenging violence

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,040
To me the most foundational thing

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Is that the entire concept is built on affection

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,960
And the entire concept is built on respect of the other

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,400
Not just respect of the other person from your religion

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,920
But respect of the other from every religion

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,400
So some of why I thought I should go and see the golden temple

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
I had been there before

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,600
And the interesting thing was that when I went there before

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,880
I had Matha takeout and I sat in the harmender's eye

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
But I didn't do Shiva

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,320
Now when I did Shiva it completely transformed the experience for me

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,760
Because I felt when I am quietly cleaning the katori

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,960
I am suddenly feeling that oh I am part of a group of people who is cleaning this katori

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,400
And I am doing the work that is promoting what Guru Nanak said

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,520
I am part of community a larger system

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
That is protecting an idea

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,160
So that was very interesting to me

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Each one of the savers I made some friends I made friends with little girl in the

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,160
Shoo Shiva which frankly I really loved working with her

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
She is very cute

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,600
And then there was couple little kids also

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,400
And then even other people who I met

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Really who were very affectionate

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,400
You know if you look at Indian society today

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,240
And you see the anger and you see the hatred that is being spread in society

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,480
Has many examples in history Guru Nanak being one of them

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,320
That actually guide us on the path that we should be working on

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,080
And it is unfortunate that with such a treasure that this land has

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,560
We don't seriously look at that treasure

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,400
We are so busy doing our thing, trying to succeed

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,440
Trying to impress other people

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,160
Trying to make money, trying to be famous

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,440
That we forget that actually the real treasure that India brings to the world

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Probably more than any other land

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Or these great people

80
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,760
We are going through a phase

81
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,480
Where wisdom is lacking

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,800
Wisdom is not how intelligent you are or how smart you are or clever you are

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,560
Wisdom is how effective you are at going to the truth

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,080
Guru Nanak is wise

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,720
Mahatma Gandhi is wise, Buddha is wise

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,280
They might not have been at the time wealthy or powerful or had a lot of force

87
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,920
I don't think Guru Nanak had much force

88
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
Almost no force

89
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,800
But he had huge amount of power because he was closer to the truth

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,680
So my view is that force is always alive

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Power is always the truth

92
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,520
So for example the United States is called Super Power

93
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
It's not a Super Power, it's a Super Force

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,280
Gandhi is a Super Power

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Guru Nanak is a Super Power

96
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
And force is always destructive

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Because force is always used

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
With fear attached to it

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
It's always used with anger

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,760
It's always used with hatred

101
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm early on in my journey

102
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,080
It's not that I am reached anywhere

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,600
But I find that if I'm operating in the realm of power and I have to

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,240
You see I don't have force compared to the BJP

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I don't have force compared to the RSS

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,520
They have force

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
They have the government of India

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
They have institutions, they have CBI, they have E to do whatever they do

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,920
So the only thing I have

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,560
And I cannot tell you how beautiful it is

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
Is I have the truth

112
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,960
And no matter what they do they can keep going

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Their force does nothing

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,240
To the truth, it just doesn't

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,080
So that's what I would like

116
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,920
Young Indian people to understand

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm very happy

118
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,400
K. Raujan he understood this

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,760
And he did not come like any other VIP to Ratea

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Or go Matha, K. Ratea or Chalaj Ratea

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,400
I was so impressed

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
He was asking questions

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,640
And it was not that you've talked about something

124
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
And then it is left hanging

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
It was concluded

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
The observations were there

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
And then coming to a crux

128
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Regey about the Acharya, Yatheekhoya

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,840
Up then we would move forward

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,880
Said with a very very engaging conversation

131
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,200
I feel that bar sir, B.K. S.I.S.A.

132
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Sir, B.P.A.P.A.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,120
If he is talking about the truth,

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,880
He is a selfless chef

135
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
People will get influence by what he is doing

136
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
And I think they will also come forward

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
Said with a lot of love

138
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,440
It is good to talk about the truth

139
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,600
In Gurubani, he says, he is a man

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,920
That means he is there for those who surrender themselves

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,880
To him

142
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
And letting your ego go

143
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Said with a lot of love

144
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,000
That is the message
